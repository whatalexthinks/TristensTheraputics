Tristenâ€™s Therapeutics







Advanced Bodywork for Active Lives





Welcome to Tristenâ€™s Therapeutics, where massage meets movement science. My name is Tristen, and I specialize in deep, focused therapeutic bodywork for people who train hard, move often, and expect real results.



Whether youâ€™re an athlete, lifter, cyclist, weekend warrior, long distance runner, or someone recovering from injury, I combine powerful, hands-on techniques with a deep understanding of the body to help you move better, feel stronger, and heal smarter.







 

What I Offer









Active Release Technique (ARTÂ®)





For overuse injuries, chronic tightness, and movement restrictions.

ART is a precise, hands-on method used to break up adhesions, improve tissue quality, and restore nerve mobility. This technique is perfect for those dealing with:



Shoulder or neck pain
Low back stiffness or sciatica
Tennis/golferâ€™s elbow
Carpal tunnel, knee pain, or plantar fasciitis
Mobility limitations from overtraining or old injuries




Sessions available as 30 or 45-minute focused treatments.











Therapeutic Massage Therapy





Not your average massage. This is strategic, restorative, and deeply healing.

I tailor every session to your goalsâ€”combining a range of advanced bodywork techniques to address chronic tension, muscular imbalances, and structural restrictions.



Expect a mix of:



Deep Tissue
Trigger Point Therapy
Myofascial Release
Structural Integration
Guided Breathwork
Optional Reiki/Energy Balancing (for those seeking deeper internal alignment)




Sessions range from 75, 90, or 120 minutes, available in-home or mobile. First-time mobile clients get their travel fee waived. 

$20 mobile service fee 








Combo Sessions: ART + Massage





The best of both worlds: targeted tissue therapy and full-body recovery.

Perfect for athletes or rehab clients who need both precision and reset.



90 min: 30 min ART + 60 min massage
120 min: 45 min ART + 75 min massage
